Version 0.4.0 [2020-08-23]
--------------------------

Features
~~~~~~~~

- [models] Added `organizations_managed
  <https://github.com/openwisp/openwisp-users#organizations-managed>`_
  helper
- [models] Added `organizations_owned
  <https://github.com/openwisp/openwisp-users#organizations-owned>`_
  helper

Changes
~~~~~~~

- [admin]: **Potentially backward incompatible change**: Multi-tenant
  admin classes now allow only org managers. Before this version, a user
  needed to be only org member to see items of that organization in the
  admin, but this is wrong! An ``OrganizationUser`` which has
  ``is_admin=False`` is only an end-user of that organization. Instead, an
  ``OrganizationUser`` which has ``is_admin=True`` is also a manager and
  only this type of user shall be allowed to manage items of the
  organization through the django admin site. This is needed in order to
  support users being simple end-users in one organization but
  administrators in others, otherwise a staff user who is administrator of
  one organization would be able to change also items of other
  organizations where they are only members and not managers.
