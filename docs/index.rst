Users
=====

The OpenWISP Users module leverages the capabilities of the `Django Framework
<https://djangoproject.com/>`_ and its rich ecosystem to provide OpenWISP with features
for managing user accounts, permission groups, supporting different authentication
schemes, implementing multi-tenancy for allowing multiple organizations to be managed by
different users within a single OpenWISP instance and more.
