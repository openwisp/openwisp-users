Users
=====

The OpenWISP Users module leverages the capabilities of the Django Framework and its
reach ecosystem to provide OpenWISP with features for managing user accounts, permission
groups, supporting different authentication schemes, implementing multitenancy to
allowing multiple organizations to be managed by different users within a single
OpenWISP instance and more.
